## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

<br/>

### 🏪 StoreTrack 2 — *The upgrade that mattered*
> **The upgraded store management system — built for real businesses.**

A full-featured inventory and store tracking system. Designed to solve actual day-to-day challenges faced by store owners — tracking stock, managing records, and keeping operations smooth. Built better because I listened to what the first version got wrong.

![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-4479A1?style=flat-square&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

### 📦 StoreTrack — *Where it all began*
> **Where it all began — my first real-world solution.**

The original StoreTrack. Built from scratch to understand how stores work and how software can make them better. Not perfect — but real, and that matters more.

### 🚲 Rental Bikes — *Making movement easier*
> **A bike rental platform built for real users with real needs.**

A web-based rental bike system that lets users browse, book, and manage bike rentals. Built to tackle a practical everyday problem in a simple, usable way. Every feature came from thinking: *"what would the actual user need?"*
