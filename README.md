## 👋 Namaste! I'm Abhiyan.

I'm a BCA student at Patan Multiple Campus and a Developer based in 🌏 Nepal. I'm on a mission to turn real-world problems into working software.

I didn't start coding for a title—I started because I kept seeing things around me that software could fix. That curiosity turned into 3 real-world projects, and those projects became a passion I can't put down.

I'm currently focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I use AI to understand complex concepts and speed up my workflow, but I’m equally committed to coding manually to master the logic behind every build.

> 💡 *" I also strongly believe that The best software isn't born in textbooks — it's born from problems worth solving."*

## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

<div align="center">

### 🏪 StoreTrack 2
**The upgraded store management system — built for real businesses.**

A full-featured inventory and store tracking system. Designed to solve actual day-to-day challenges faced by store owners — tracking stock, managing records, and keeping operations smooth. Built better because I listened to what the first version got wrong.

### 📦 StoreTrack
**Where it all began — my first real-world solution.**

The original StoreTrack. Built from scratch to understand how stores work and how software can make them better. Not perfect — but real, and that matters more.

### 🏍️ Bike Rental
**Making two-wheel rentals simple and digital.**

A web-based bike rental management system. Handles bookings, availability, and records — turning a manual, paper-based process into a clean digital workflow.
